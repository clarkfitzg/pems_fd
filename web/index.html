<h1>PEMS stations fundamental diagrams</h1>

<p>This is a brief set of working notes for a project analyzing highway traffic sensor data.</p>
<p>This map shows traffic sensors colored based on the shape of their fundamental diagram. Zoom and click the points for more information.</p>

<p>The capacity is the highest point on the fundamental diagram, the point where the left and mid lines meet. It's in units of vehicles per hour.</p>
<h2>Fundamental Diagrams</h2>
<p>The image below shows the medoid (average) shapes of the clusters. A few notes:</p>
<ul>
<li>Steeper slopes on the right hand side mean that traffic clears out faster</li>
<li>The green line is concave while the orange one is not.</li>
<li>Some regions are mostly orange, such as I 680 around San Ramon</li>
<li>Other regions are mixed, such as the Bay Bridge connecting San Francisco and Oakland</li>
</ul>
<p><img src="cluster_fd.svg" alt="Representative Fundamental Diagrams" /></p>
<p>The three separate lines come from fitting points in different regions:</p>
<ul>
<li>Left line comes from fitting in (0, 0.1)</li>
<li>Center line comes from fitting in (0.2, 0.5)</li>
<li>Right line comes from fitting in (0.5, 1)</li>
</ul>
<p>I fit the lines using least squares subject to the constraints that the fundamental diagram must pass through (0, 0) and (1, 0). I ignored the points in the region (0.1, 0.2) because points vary widely in this region as the traffic transitions to a congested state.</p>
<h2>Clustering</h2>
<p>I used a kernel based method to cluster the stations. The kernel is based on the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dot_product#Functions">inner product between functions</a> over the interval (0, 1).</p>
<h2>Computation</h2>
<p>Computation currently consists of the following steps:</p>
<ul>
<li>Download 10 months of 30 second sensor data for the Bay Area from the <a href="http://pems.dot.ca.gov/">CalTrans Performance Measurement System</a> (PEMS) into Hadoop</li>
<li>Use <a href="http://clarkfitzg.github.io/2017/10/31/3-billion-rows-with-R/">Hive with R</a> to group data by station and fit the fundamental diagrams for each station</li>
<li>Compute the kernel matrix between all fundamental diagrams using numerical integration (just for fun, it also has an analytic form)</li>
</ul>
